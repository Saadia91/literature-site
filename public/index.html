						               	It had been 35 minutes. 35 painstaking long minutes since her brother had darted off with the phaeton, leaving her stranded in the middle of Hyde Park. Without an abigail, no less, and at an hour when all of London's society was out in full force. At one and twenty, Felicity Billings had grown accustomed to her brother's flighty whims. Charles was a good sort, but being born to a father whose family had made their fortune in trade gave the 18 year old a sense of inadequacy amongst his companions. Having attended Eton, and now Cambridge at their father’s insistence, his friends ranged from those who held titles and lands to those belonging to some of the oldest families in the country. <br/><br/>

						               	Charles, never one to be outdone, was consistently involved in one scrape or another, as if he had something to prove. But he had gone too far this time. At the insistence of his friend, the second son of a Baron, he had taken on a challenge to race the phaeton to Mayfair and back but not before demanding Felicity step down from the carriage because, of course, his honour would not permit him have a female take part in such an activity. Felicity was furious. They should have been back by now, but here she stood, like a wanton with no ladies maid or chaperon in sight. She wished that Charles would grow out of this feeling of inadequacy. As if he were ashamed of his family.<br/><br/>

						               	Not that their family should be ashamed of their standing in society. After all, money forgives many things, even an un-genteel birth. As their Father was always preaching to them, “If you can’t be born into it, you can buy into it! Just like I did with your Mama.” A statement which had the effect of sending their mama into the vapours. “I was not bought like some livestock at the market”, she would argue. However, although their mother was of a genteel birth, she was only the daughter of the second son of a Knight. Her father was a mere Vicar to a small parish in Hertfordshire, so the possession of a large fortune did much to assistance them in the society their father so ardently desired to be a part of. Plus, with all the titled gentlemen with pockets to let, the need for a fortune amongst the quality set was evident. And a fortune they had. Felicity's Grandfather had racked up a substantial sum in the shipping industry followed by some tidy investments in a few mining companies. So substantial was the Billing's fortune, it had gained them entrance into society's most illustrious circles. <br/><br/>

						               	Yes, money had a habit of forgiving many things. There were a few families who turned their noses up at those they termed "upstarts" and Felicity had had some unpleasant encounters with a debutante or two who had tried to put the young heiress in her place on her first come out, but with so many families in need of a fortune to save their way of life and precious family names, many had learned to swallow their pride.<br/><br/>

						               	This, however, meant that Felicity’s only suitors were fortune hunters. Her parents might have no qualms about selling their daughter to a titled gentleman without a sixpence to scratch with, but Felicity didn’t share their ambitions. So, at one and twenty - four years after her come out to society - she was, by choice, still unwed.  The way she saw it, these ‘gentlemen’ needed her more than she needed them. <br/><br/>

						               	One of these so called gentlemen had just spotted her from across the park. Rupert Grangewood, the Viscount of somewhere or another, had been her most persistent suitor for the past year. He had barely noticed her on her first and second year but rumour had it, he had racked up a hefty sum at the gaming hells last year and his family’s estates were in foreclosure, which meant he needed a hefty sum to keep him out of debtor’s prison. He was also amongst the pink set, so his toilette alone would most likely rack up a fortune. <br/><br/>

						               	Her parents had humoured him. He was, after all, a Viscount. But, fortunately for Felicity, they had higher ambitions and believed their money, coupled with Felicity’s pleasant enough looks, were substantial enough to buy a Marquee or a Duke. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t know of many purse pinched Dukes on the market. So, hesitantly, the Viscount’s attentions were received.<br/><br/>
										
										Receiving the odious Viscount to appease her parents was one thing, but being seen out in public, alone, with him was quite another. She would never forgive Charles for placing her in this hobble. She had to think fast. Perhaps she could make her way to the other side of the park and lose him amongst the throngs of carriages. It would be a miracle if she wasn’t noticed by anyone else amongst her acquaintances. <br/><br/>
										

										She tilted her bonnet to the left, shielding the side of her face where she had seen the Viscount, and stepped off the main path and onto the grass. With her head bent low, she made her way towards the entrance of the park, side stepping a family of ducks making their way to the pond. The farther she went, the more confident she felt about her decision to go to the entrance. Surely, her brother would be on his way back now and she could meet him there. If he entered through another gate and wasn’t able to locate her, well, it would serve him right for abandoning her. But where would that leave her? She stepped back onto the main path as a hedge bush blocked her from reaching the entrance gates. So lost was she in her brooding that she failed to hear the clomping of the fast approaching horse. Too late, a man’s raised voice called “out of the way!” <br/><br/>

										Turning back, she just had time to glimpse the rider’s failed efforts to halt his mare whilst staying mounted. The large black stallion kicked up his front legs in a most ferocious way and a look of shock registered on the riders face just before he went down, into the hedge bush with a thunk. <br/><br/>

										“Oh!” Felicity gasped. Caught between worry for the rider and amusement at the awkward position he had landed in, Felicity giggled. She never did well in awkward situations. Honestly, how long did he intend on laying in the bush with his legs in the air? She stiffened, realising he might be unconscious from his fall. Perhaps he’d had a knock to the head? As she stepped closer to get a better look at him, she heard him mutter the most abominable profanity. “Sir!” She gasped in horror. <br/><br/>

										Before she could say more, she heard the clomping of fast approaching hoofs and remembered herself. At the corner of her eye, she saw a party of men and women riding their way and recognised Cynthia Blackwood. One of the gentlemen riding ahead of the pack, Mr Dingburry she believed, called out “Blackwood, are you alright?” <br/><br/>

										Now was the time to make a hasty retreat, before she was recognised. She ducked her head once more and hurried towards the entrance. This was all her brothers fault. She’d never forgive him for this. She’d almost been caught by that fatwit Cynthia Blackwood. And, by the sounds of it, her brother, Nathaniel Blackwood, was the rider who had almost ran her down. So, that was the famous wastrel who’d tried to abduct an heiress the year she’d made her come out. The Blackwood’s had apparently decided to welcome Nathaniel back into their folds after banishing him to the continent. <br/><br/>

										Cynthia had been one of the debutantes who had dubbed Felicity an upstart on the year she came out and given her the cut direct. It had hurt, initially, but it was soon borne into her that many of the young ladies on the marriage mart would view her as one of their biggest rivals. Felicity was no beauty, but neither was she plain. Her dark brown hair, deep brown eyes and wide generous mouth meant that she was not in the style of the season. However, with 50,000 a year to recommend her, plus the estate she would come in to upon her 25th birthday, beauty was not, after all, so very important. <br/><br/>

										Cynthia, on the other hand, was everything she was not. A distant relative of the famous Earl of De Montfort, she was what the Beau Monde had coined ‘a diamond of the first’. Her blonde curly ringlets, striking blue eyes and clear pale complexion had ensured she was never short of dance partners. But, she too, was now embarking on her fourth season. Although Cynthia had received offers from a few well-meaning gentlemen, none had had the right circumstances the family needed for their dwindling finances. <br/><br/>

										So, like Felicity, Cynthia was still unmarried. Unlike Felicity, it was not by choice. Felicity would be perfectly comfortable if she didn’t find a husband at the end of her seasons, but Cynthia would be forced to go into service as either a governess or a lady’s companion. This was probably the cause of her growing resentment. With this in mind, Felicity half ran to the entrance gate, praying her nemesis had not recognised her. She believed the big black mare Cynthia’s brother had fallen from had shielded her from the group. <br/><br/>

										At the entrance of the park, she spotted her brother riding towards her on top of a grey mare she had never before seen. <br/><br/>
										
										With a sheepish smile, he said “Sorry I’m late sis. You won’t believe what I’ve just been through. I was lucky to have escaped with my… Don’t look at me like that. Honestly, if you only knew-” <br/><br/>

										She raised her hand to silence him. <br/><br/>

										“Where is the phaeton, Charlie?” She asked, barely holding onto her temper. “And I’ll have none of your fustian nonsense.” <br/><br/>

										He exhaled “Oh Fliss, I’ve really made a mull of it this time!”

					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine smiled now, as she stared out at the lake, and remembered the way Mr William’s hand had brushed her shoulder the night before when nobody was watching. What a fine man! The most charming and handsome she had laid her eyes upon. Most ladies to come across him were instantly smitten, including Jessamine, and she prided the fact that he clearly had an interest in her.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	The attention Mr William paid to Jessamine had not been lost on Emily Beaton, the younger of the two sisters who happened to be Jessamine’s cousins, although they had never got along. She definitely had not missed when Mr William quickly slipped his hand into Jessamine’s for a brief second in passing, while they thought nobody was watching. Emily certainly would not have noticed if she had not been watching Mr William so intensely all night.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	What Emily did not know was that Mr William was passing a note to Jessamine, telling her to meet him at the lake at a quarter past midnight the very next night. Jessamine hid the note and it had felt as if it was burning a hole into her glove the whole rest of the night, but she knew she couldn’t open it at the ball in front of everyone. As she slipped the note into her glove, she caught a glimpse of Emily Beaton, eyes fixed on her, but Emily quickly averted her gaze when she noticed Jessamine looking back at her.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	What a curious exchange it was! Emily felt tempted to ask about the brief encounter but did not want Jessamine to be aware that she had caught on to something between the two.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Have you been enjoying yourself, Jessamine?’ Emily Beaton asked.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine was far too excited about the events of the night to entertain Beaton and so replied, ‘Yes, thank you very much, Emily’ and she bowed her head and walked away, without so much as asking how Miss Beaton was enjoying her night, much to her displeasure.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine sighed as she waited by the tree, looking out towards the lake. She was sure that it was far past a quarter past midnight and she was beginning to grow cold. She wished that she had been able to tell her maid, Lucy, about this secret meeting, as her stays were coming loose, seeing as she had to dress herself, but she could not risk being caught leaving her bedroom at this hour of the night. The servants might talk and it was not proper for a young lady to be out alone with a man her father had not given his approval of, especially at this time of the night.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine wondered if she’d somehow read Mr William’s letter wrong. Did she have the wrong night, possibly the wrong time? Or perhaps, Jessamine thought, Mr William had come to his senses and realised that he had no business in pursuing her. Their situation was rather unique.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine turned to leave. It was getting far too cold and it wasn’t safe for her to be outside all alone. However, when she turned, she saw a dark figure walking towards her. A sudden panic came over her. What if it wasn’t Mr William? What if the whole thing was a set-up? But she needn’t worry.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Miss Watson?’ Oh how she’d never tire of hearing his voice utter her name.<br>
					               	‘James.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Mr William placed his hand on Jessamine’s cheek, much to her surprise. He had never been so forward with her, although they had also never been alone together.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘You’re cold. I’m sorry I have kept you waiting, Miss Watson.’<br>
					               	‘Never mind about that. You’re here now.’ She placed her hand on top of his but he quickly slipped his away and turned to face the lake.<br>
					               	‘Yes.’<br>
					               	‘Is something the matter, Mr William?’<br>
					               	‘I just cannot seem to shake the feeling that this is very wrong, Miss Watson. I’m sorry for wasting your time but I must take you home now.’<br>
					               	Jessamine shook her head. ‘No, you haven’t. I didn’t manage to pack any of my things but if we leave now we can make it to Gretna Green by-’<br>
					               	‘Gretna Green?’ Mr William turned back to face Jessamine, eyes wide. ‘I’m sorry to have misled you, Miss Watson, but we cannot elope to Gretna Green.’<br>
					               	Jessamine placed her hand on Mr William’s arm. ‘But why not?’<br>
					               	‘You know very well why not, Miss Watson.’<br>
					               	‘Very well then.’ Jessamine bowed her head, lifted her skirts and turned to run back home.
					               </p>

					               <p class="text-center">***</p>

					               <p>
					               	‘Jessie.’ her younger sister, Rosanna, whispered as they lay in bed the very same night. It was not an uncommon practice for Rosanna to sneak into her bedroom and join her whenever she was having a bad dream. Jessamine had returned to find her asleep in her bed and had tried her best to undress quietly.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Hmm?’ Jessamine stroked her sister’s hair as they lay beside each other.<br>
					               	‘Did you go to see the man you danced with at the ball?’<br>
					               	Jessamine’s eyes, which were drooping a moment before, shot wide open. ‘You read too many fairy tales, Rose.’<br>
					               	‘I won’t tell. I just saw him passing you something at the ball.’<br>
					               	‘It was nothing. Forget it.’<br>
					               	‘Do you think he’ll ask for your hand, Jessie?’<br>
					               	‘I doubt that very much, Rose. Now go to sleep.’
					               </p>

					               <p class="text-center">***</p>

					               <p>
					               	It was 10am. Jessamine stood at the back of the church as she watched the guests of the wedding arrive. It was a rather large sum of people but she wasn’t surprised. It was typical of the Beaton’s to make such a show of things and inviting as many guests as possible was the best way for the family to do that. Jessamine was certain that she would not invite the Beaton’s to her eventual wedding. She did not need their beady eyes watching her every move and ruining her special day. Her wedding would be small, only immediate family and close friends.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Mrs Watson appeared at Jessamine’s side. ‘It’s time to take a seat, dear.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	As they walked arm in arm to their pew, where they were to be seated beside her two sisters, Jessamine couldn’t help but imagine for a second that it was her own wedding that she was walking down the aisle to. Jessamine watched the groom fidget with his clothing, first his collar, then his coat and his collar again. She was sure that if his tailcoat was taken off, damp marks would stain his shirt at the underarms. His nerves were understandable, marrying one of the Beaton ladies. Finally, a hush fell over the church. Isabella Beaton, the elder of the two sisters, walked with her father down the aisle in a light blue dress.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	This was Jessamine’s least favourite part of the wedding. She grew restless as she listened to the priest. Mrs Watson placed her hand on Jessamine’s knee. She had been shaking her leg, a habit that she didn’t notice she was doing most of the time. Her mother was constantly reminding her to break it as it was unladylike, not to mention irritating.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Therefore, if any man can show any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She could not help herself. Jessamine shot up from her seat before she even had the chance to think about what she was doing.<br>
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Jessamine!’ Her mother tugged at her dress. ‘Sit down.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	All eyes were on her, and she could almost feel Emily Beaton’s glare, but Jessamine took no notice. All she could see was the love of her life standing at the alter with another woman; an undeserving woman.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘They cannot be wed.’ Jessamine moved out of her pew, much to her mother’s protest, and stood in the aisle of the church. ‘They cannot be wed because I am in love with James, and he with me.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She could hear the mutterings of the people in the church but chose to ignore it, instead walking towards the back of the building.<br>
					               	‘Is this true?’ Isabella asked her husband to be.<br>
					               	Mr William looked from Isabella to Jessamine and back again. He took a step away from his bride. ‘I’m terribly sorry, but…’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine willed for the groom to look at her. All she needed was a second of eye contact. He turned his head towards her and she nodded at him. Mr William hesitated for a second and then made a break for it towards Jessamine. She placed her hand in his, much to everyone’s shock, and they ran out of the church towards the carriage.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘To Gretna Green?’ Mr William asked.<br>
					               	She nodded. ‘To Gretna Green.’<br>
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine blinked. She was back in the church again, sitting beside her mother and sister, Elizabeth.<br>
					               	‘I, James William, take thee, Isabella Beaton, to be my wedded wife.’<br>
					               	Jessamine sighed. She never was a big fan of weddings anyway.

I wish people still sent letters but the fact that they don’t just makes them that much more special. I’d like to think that one day someone will think of me and decide to put pen to paper and write to me. Their thoughts, their feelings, anything. I’d keep that piece of paper forever, put it in my special box of memories and smile every time I looked at it. Maybe they’d even spray it with a scent so that I’d think of them and their words every time I smelt it.

					               <p>
					               	I do things that I wish people would do for me. I write letters in the hopes that someday someone will write one to me. Maybe I watch too many movies and have this romantic idea of life that just isn’t a reality, but if I can’t experience that little bit of magic in the world then why not make it happen for someone else?
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Do you ever remember someone from your childhood and wonder if they think of you? Like someone who you were friends with for a short while but for some reason that friendship didn’t last? There was no official breaking of the friendship, it just kind of faded away, but for that short time you really valued that person’s company? Do you ever wonder if that person thinks of that short time too? Do you ever wonder if they even remember it happened? Do you wonder if they valued it as much as you did?
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I want you to know that I’m thinking of you. Before I started writing this letter, I was thinking of you. As I sit here expressing my thoughts, I am thinking of you. When I seal the envelope and place the stamp on its corner, I will think of you.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I hope you will value this letter as much as I would. I hope you get excited when you receive your mail and realise that you’ve been sent a letter which isn’t a bill or an expected delivery or a subscription. I hope you will get a giddy feeling inside and wonder what it could possibly say inside. I hope you won’t be disappointed at the words you read or the fact that it was sent from me. I hope you feel special and loved, and I hope you know that your friendship meant everything to me.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	It breaks my heart to know that things between us will never be the same again, that at one point you were my everything and now I’m beginning to fear that I’ll forget someday. I’ll forget the sound of your voice or the smell of your cologne. One thing I know for certain is that I’ll never forget the memories that we shared. They’re forever ingrained in my memory. They always will be.
