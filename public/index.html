					               	Jessamine counted to one hundred for the sixth time inside her head. The thrill of sneaking out of her bedroom at midnight to meet a gentleman was beginning to wear off as she waited for Mr William to arrive. Her James William. Butterflies returned in Jessamine’s stomach as she reminisced about her first dance with Mr William at the Grigori ball, and all the dances they had had since that night. Of course, they only danced once per night to keep up appearances.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine always blushed when she thought back to the first time Mr William had ever spoken to her in his low, husky voice. ‘May I have this dance, Miss Watson, if you are not engaged?’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She had replied that he may, all the while blushing, and in the moments that they danced, she had wished that she had not been wearing gloves so that their skin could make contact in those brief caresses.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine smiled now, as she stared out at the lake, and remembered the way Mr William’s hand had brushed her shoulder the night before when nobody was watching. What a fine man! The most charming and handsome she had laid her eyes upon. Most ladies to come across him were instantly smitten, including Jessamine, and she prided the fact that he clearly had an interest in her.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	The attention Mr William paid to Jessamine had not been lost on Emily Beaton, the younger of the two sisters who happened to be Jessamine’s cousins, although they had never got along. She definitely had not missed when Mr William quickly slipped his hand into Jessamine’s for a brief second in passing, while they thought nobody was watching. Emily certainly would not have noticed if she had not been watching Mr William so intensely all night.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	What Emily did not know was that Mr William was passing a note to Jessamine, telling her to meet him at the lake at a quarter past midnight the very next night. Jessamine hid the note and it had felt as if it was burning a hole into her glove the whole rest of the night, but she knew she couldn’t open it at the ball in front of everyone. As she slipped the note into her glove, she caught a glimpse of Emily Beaton, eyes fixed on her, but Emily quickly averted her gaze when she noticed Jessamine looking back at her.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	What a curious exchange it was! Emily felt tempted to ask about the brief encounter but did not want Jessamine to be aware that she had caught on to something between the two.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Have you been enjoying yourself, Jessamine?’ Emily Beaton asked.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine was far too excited about the events of the night to entertain Beaton and so replied, ‘Yes, thank you very much, Emily’ and she bowed her head and walked away, without so much as asking how Miss Beaton was enjoying her night, much to her displeasure.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine sighed as she waited by the tree, looking out towards the lake. She was sure that it was far past a quarter past midnight and she was beginning to grow cold. She wished that she had been able to tell her maid, Lucy, about this secret meeting, as her stays were coming loose, seeing as she had to dress herself, but she could not risk being caught leaving her bedroom at this hour of the night. The servants might talk and it was not proper for a young lady to be out alone with a man her father had not given his approval of, especially at this time of the night.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine wondered if she’d somehow read Mr William’s letter wrong. Did she have the wrong night, possibly the wrong time? Or perhaps, Jessamine thought, Mr William had come to his senses and realised that he had no business in pursuing her. Their situation was rather unique.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine turned to leave. It was getting far too cold and it wasn’t safe for her to be outside all alone. However, when she turned, she saw a dark figure walking towards her. A sudden panic came over her. What if it wasn’t Mr William? What if the whole thing was a set-up? But she needn’t worry.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Miss Watson?’ Oh how she’d never tire of hearing his voice utter her name.<br>
					               	‘James.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Mr William placed his hand on Jessamine’s cheek, much to her surprise. He had never been so forward with her, although they had also never been alone together.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘You’re cold. I’m sorry I have kept you waiting, Miss Watson.’<br>
					               	‘Never mind about that. You’re here now.’ She placed her hand on top of his but he quickly slipped his away and turned to face the lake.<br>
					               	‘Yes.’<br>
					               	‘Is something the matter, Mr William?’<br>
					               	‘I just cannot seem to shake the feeling that this is very wrong, Miss Watson. I’m sorry for wasting your time but I must take you home now.’<br>
					               	Jessamine shook her head. ‘No, you haven’t. I didn’t manage to pack any of my things but if we leave now we can make it to Gretna Green by-’<br>
					               	‘Gretna Green?’ Mr William turned back to face Jessamine, eyes wide. ‘I’m sorry to have misled you, Miss Watson, but we cannot elope to Gretna Green.’<br>
					               	Jessamine placed her hand on Mr William’s arm. ‘But why not?’<br>
					               	‘You know very well why not, Miss Watson.’<br>
					               	‘Very well then.’ Jessamine bowed her head, lifted her skirts and turned to run back home.
					               </p>

					               <p class="text-center">***</p>

					               <p>
					               	‘Jessie.’ her younger sister, Rosanna, whispered as they lay in bed the very same night. It was not an uncommon practice for Rosanna to sneak into her bedroom and join her whenever she was having a bad dream. Jessamine had returned to find her asleep in her bed and had tried her best to undress quietly.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Hmm?’ Jessamine stroked her sister’s hair as they lay beside each other.<br>
					               	‘Did you go to see the man you danced with at the ball?’<br>
					               	Jessamine’s eyes, which were drooping a moment before, shot wide open. ‘You read too many fairy tales, Rose.’<br>
					               	‘I won’t tell. I just saw him passing you something at the ball.’<br>
					               	‘It was nothing. Forget it.’<br>
					               	‘Do you think he’ll ask for your hand, Jessie?’<br>
					               	‘I doubt that very much, Rose. Now go to sleep.’
					               </p>

					               <p class="text-center">***</p>

					               <p>
					               	It was 10am. Jessamine stood at the back of the church as she watched the guests of the wedding arrive. It was a rather large sum of people but she wasn’t surprised. It was typical of the Beaton’s to make such a show of things and inviting as many guests as possible was the best way for the family to do that. Jessamine was certain that she would not invite the Beaton’s to her eventual wedding. She did not need their beady eyes watching her every move and ruining her special day. Her wedding would be small, only immediate family and close friends.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Mrs Watson appeared at Jessamine’s side. ‘It’s time to take a seat, dear.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	As they walked arm in arm to their pew, where they were to be seated beside her two sisters, Jessamine couldn’t help but imagine for a second that it was her own wedding that she was walking down the aisle to. Jessamine watched the groom fidget with his clothing, first his collar, then his coat and his collar again. She was sure that if his tailcoat was taken off, damp marks would stain his shirt at the underarms. His nerves were understandable, marrying one of the Beaton ladies. Finally, a hush fell over the church. Isabella Beaton, the elder of the two sisters, walked with her father down the aisle in a light blue dress.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	This was Jessamine’s least favourite part of the wedding. She grew restless as she listened to the priest. Mrs Watson placed her hand on Jessamine’s knee. She had been shaking her leg, a habit that she didn’t notice she was doing most of the time. Her mother was constantly reminding her to break it as it was unladylike, not to mention irritating.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Therefore, if any man can show any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She could not help herself. Jessamine shot up from her seat before she even had the chance to think about what she was doing.<br>
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Jessamine!’ Her mother tugged at her dress. ‘Sit down.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	All eyes were on her, and she could almost feel Emily Beaton’s glare, but Jessamine took no notice. All she could see was the love of her life standing at the alter with another woman; an undeserving woman.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘They cannot be wed.’ Jessamine moved out of her pew, much to her mother’s protest, and stood in the aisle of the church. ‘They cannot be wed because I am in love with James, and he with me.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She could hear the mutterings of the people in the church but chose to ignore it, instead walking towards the back of the building.<br>
					               	‘Is this true?’ Isabella asked her husband to be.<br>
					               	Mr William looked from Isabella to Jessamine and back again. He took a step away from his bride. ‘I’m terribly sorry, but…’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine willed for the groom to look at her. All she needed was a second of eye contact. He turned his head towards her and she nodded at him. Mr William hesitated for a second and then made a break for it towards Jessamine. She placed her hand in his, much to everyone’s shock, and they ran out of the church towards the carriage.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘To Gretna Green?’ Mr William asked.<br>
					               	She nodded. ‘To Gretna Green.’<br>
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine blinked. She was back in the church again, sitting beside her mother and sister, Elizabeth.<br>
					               	‘I, James William, take thee, Isabella Beaton, to be my wedded wife.’<br>
					               	Jessamine sighed. She never was a big fan of weddings anyway.

					               	As I sit down to write this, I imagine what you will think when you open the envelope. Who even sends letters anymore? I wish people still sent letters but the fact that they don’t just makes them that much more special. I’d like to think that one day someone will think of me and decide to put pen to paper and write to me. Their thoughts, their feelings, anything. I’d keep that piece of paper forever, put it in my special box of memories and smile every time I looked at it. Maybe they’d even spray it with a scent so that I’d think of them and their words every time I smelt it.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I do things that I wish people would do for me. I write letters in the hopes that someday someone will write one to me. Maybe I watch too many movies and have this romantic idea of life that just isn’t a reality, but if I can’t experience that little bit of magic in the world then why not make it happen for someone else?
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Do you ever remember someone from your childhood and wonder if they think of you? Like someone who you were friends with for a short while but for some reason that friendship didn’t last? There was no official breaking of the friendship, it just kind of faded away, but for that short time you really valued that person’s company? Do you ever wonder if that person thinks of that short time too? Do you ever wonder if they even remember it happened? Do you wonder if they valued it as much as you did?
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I want you to know that I’m thinking of you. Before I started writing this letter, I was thinking of you. As I sit here expressing my thoughts, I am thinking of you. When I seal the envelope and place the stamp on its corner, I will think of you.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I hope you will value this letter as much as I would. I hope you get excited when you receive your mail and realise that you’ve been sent a letter which isn’t a bill or an expected delivery or a subscription. I hope you will get a giddy feeling inside and wonder what it could possibly say inside. I hope you won’t be disappointed at the words you read or the fact that it was sent from me. I hope you feel special and loved, and I hope you know that your friendship meant everything to me.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	It breaks my heart to know that things between us will never be the same again, that at one point you were my everything and now I’m beginning to fear that I’ll forget someday. I’ll forget the sound of your voice or the smell of your cologne. One thing I know for certain is that I’ll never forget the memories that we shared. They’re forever ingrained in my memory. They always will be.
