						               	<a style="color: #bbb;">Wednesday 14th April 1813<a><br/><br/>
						               	It had been 35 minutes. 35 long minutes since her brother had raced off with the phaeton, leaving her stranded in the middle of Hyde Park. Without an chaperon, no less, and at an hour when all of London's society was out in full force. At one and twenty, Felicity Billings had grown accustomed to her brother's flighty whims. Charles was a good sort, but being born to a father whose family had made their fortune in trade gave the 18 year old a sense of inadequacy amongst his companions. Having attended Eton, and now Cambridge at their father’s insistence, his friends ranged from those who held titles and lands to those belonging to some of the oldest families in the country. <br/><br/>

						               	Charles, never one to be outdone, was consistently involved in one scrape or another, as if he had something to prove. At the insistence of his friend, the second son of a Baron, he had taken on a challenge to race the phaeton to Mayfair and back, but not before demanding Felicity step down from the carriage because, of course, his honour would not permit him have a female take part in such an activity. Felicity was furious. She wished Charles would stop trying to make up for his family’s lack of connections by accepting every challenge thrown at him. <br/><br/>

						               	Not that their family should be ashamed of their standing in society. After all, money forgives many things, even an un-genteel birth. As their Father was always preaching to them, “If you can’t be born into it, you can buy into it! Just like I did with your Mama.” A statement which had the effect of sending their mama into the vapours. “I was not bought like some livestock at the market”, she would argue. However, although their mother was of a genteel birth, she was only the daughter of the second son of a Knight. Her father was a mere Vicar to a small parish in Hertfordshire, so the possession of a large fortune did much to assistance them in the society their father so ardently desired to be a part of. Plus, with all the titled gentlemen with pockets to let, the need for a fortune amongst the quality set was evident. And a fortune they had. Felicity's Grandfather had racked up a substantial sum in the shipping industry followed by some tidy investments in a few mining companies. So substantial was the Billing's fortune, it had gained them entrance into society's most illustrious circles. <br/><br/>

						               	Yes, money had a habit of forgiving many things. There were a few families who turned their noses up at those they termed "upstarts" and Felicity had had some unpleasant encounters with a debutante or two who had tried to put the young heiress in her place on her first come out, but with so many families in need of a fortune to save their way of life and precious family names, many had learned to swallow their pride.<br/><br/>

						               	This, however, meant that Felicity’s only suitors were fortune hunters. Her parents might have no qualms about selling their daughter to a titled gentleman without a sixpence to scratch with, but Felicity didn’t share their ambitions. So, at one and twenty–four years after her come out to society–she was, by choice, still unwed.  The way she saw it, these ‘gentlemen’ needed her more than she needed them. <br/><br/>

						               	One of these so called gentlemen had just spotted her from across the park. Rupert Grangewood, the Viscount of somewhere or another, had been her most persistent suitor for the past year. He had barely noticed her on her first and second year but rumour had it, he had racked up a hefty sum at the gaming hells last year and his family’s estates were in foreclosure, which meant he needed a hefty sum to keep him out of debtor’s prison. He was also amongst the pink set, so his toilette alone would most likely rack up a fortune. <br/><br/>

						               	Her parents had humoured him. He was, after all, a Viscount. But, fortunately for Felicity, they had higher ambitions and believed their money, coupled with Felicity’s pleasant enough looks, were substantial enough to buy a Marquee or a Duke. Unfortunately for them, they didn’t know of many purse pinched Dukes on the market. So, hesitantly, the Viscount’s attentions were received.<br/><br/>
										
										Receiving the odious Viscount to appease her parents was one thing, but being seen out in public, alone, with him was quite another. She would never forgive Charles for placing her in this hobble. She had to think fast. Perhaps she could make her way to the other side of the park and lose him amongst the throngs of carriages. It would be a miracle if she wasn’t noticed by anyone else amongst her acquaintances. <br/><br/>
										

										She tilted her bonnet to the left, shielding the side of her face where she had seen the Viscount, and stepped off the main path and onto the grass. With her head bent low, she made her way towards the entrance of the park, side stepping a family of ducks making their way to the pond. The farther she went, the more confident she felt about her decision to go to the entrance. Surely, her brother would be on his way back now and she could meet him there. If he entered through another gate and wasn’t able to locate her, well, it would serve him right for abandoning her. But where would that leave her? She stepped back onto the main path as a hedge bush blocked her from reaching the entrance gates. So lost was she in her brooding that she failed to hear the clomping of the fast approaching horse. Too late, a man’s raised voice called “out of the way!” <br/><br/>

										Turning back, she just had time to glimpse the rider’s failed efforts to halt his mare whilst staying mounted. The large black stallion kicked up his front legs in a most ferocious way and a look of shock registered on the riders face just before he went down, into the hedge bush with a thunk. <br/><br/>

										“Oh!” Felicity gasped. Caught between worry for the rider and amusement at the awkward position he had landed in, Felicity giggled. She never did well in awkward situations. Honestly, how long did he intend on laying in the bush with his legs in the air? She stiffened, realising he might be unconscious from his fall. Perhaps he’d had a knock to the head? As she stepped closer to get a better look at him, she heard him mutter the most abominable profanity. “Sir!” She gasped in horror. <br/><br/>

										Before she could say more, she heard the clomping of fast approaching hoofs and remembered herself. At the corner of her eye, she saw a party of men and women riding their way and recognised Cynthia Blackwood. One of the gentlemen riding ahead of the pack, Mr Dingburry she believed, called out “Blackwood, are you alright?” <br/><br/>

										Now was the time to make a hasty retreat, before she was recognised. She ducked her head once more and hurried towards the entrance. This was all her brothers fault. She’d never forgive him for this. She’d almost been caught by that fatwit Cynthia Blackwood. And, by the sounds of it, her brother, Nathaniel Blackwood, was the rider who had almost ran her down. So, that was the famous wastrel who’d tried to abduct an heiress the year she’d made her come out. The Blackwood’s had apparently decided to welcome Nathaniel back into their folds after banishing him to the continent. <br/><br/>

										Cynthia had been one of the debutantes who had dubbed Felicity an upstart on the year she came out and given her the cut direct. It had hurt, initially, but it was soon borne into her that many of the young ladies on the marriage mart would view her as one of their biggest rivals. Felicity was no beauty, but neither was she plain. Her dark brown hair, deep brown eyes and wide generous mouth meant that she was not in the style of the season. However, with 50,000 a year to recommend her, plus the estate she would come in to upon her 25th birthday, beauty was not, after all, so very important. <br/><br/>

										Cynthia, on the other hand, was everything she was not. A distant relative of the famous Earl of De Montfort, she was what the Beau Monde had coined ‘a diamond of the first’. Her blonde curly ringlets, striking blue eyes and clear pale complexion had ensured she was never short of dance partners. But, she too, was now embarking on her fourth season. Although Cynthia had received offers from a few well-meaning gentlemen, none had had the right circumstances the family needed for their dwindling finances. <br/><br/>

										So, like Felicity, Cynthia was still unmarried. Unlike Felicity, it was not by choice. Felicity would be perfectly comfortable if she didn’t find a husband at the end of her seasons, but Cynthia would be forced to go into service as either a governess or a lady’s companion. This was probably the cause of her growing resentment. With this in mind, Felicity half ran to the entrance gate, praying her nemesis had not recognised her. She believed the big black mare Cynthia’s brother had fallen from had shielded her from the group. <br/><br/>

										At the entrance of the park, she spotted her brother riding towards her on top of a grey mare she had never before seen. His dark hair was askew and his long lean posture was hunched over–he looked defeated. <br/><br/>
										
										He caught sight of her and with a sheepish smile, he said, “Sorry I’m late sis. You won’t believe what I’ve just been through. I was lucky to have escaped with my… Don’t look at me like that. Honestly, if you only knew-” <br/><br/>

										She raised her hand to silence him. <br/><br/>

										“Where is the phaeton, Charlie?” She asked, barely holding onto her temper. “And I’ll have none of your fustian nonsense.” <br/><br/>

										He exhaled, “Oh Fliss, I’ve really made a mull of it this time!” <br/><br/>

					               	<a style="color: #bbb;">Wednesday 14th April 1813<a><br/><br/>
					               	Benjamin Alexander Blackwood, Viscount Leicester, 5th Earl of De Montfort–better known as, Leicester amongst those fortunate enough to consider themselves his nearest and dearest–untangled his right leg from the vine it had latched onto, flicked an offending twig off of his lapel, and stood up. At 6’2ft his height was as intimidating as his famous scowl. The same scowl he now wore on his face. <br/><br/>

					               	For the third time in 24 hours, he was questioning his intelligence. On the insistence of his Aunt, Cordelia, the Duchess of Surrey, he had journeyed to London the previous day to assist in the purchase of a building for a school for orphaned children. Or so he had been led to believe. For, the moment he stepped foot inside her house in Grosvenor Square, he knew he had been bamboozled. He’d expected to find her and her solicitor in her study discussing the venture but instead, the footman had lead him into the morning room where he was met with a party of long lost relatives from Kent.  <br/><br/>

					               	The Blackwoods of Kent consisted of: his late father’s 5th cousin, once removed Mr Giles Blackwood–a portly gentleman with a puffy red face and thinning grey hair, his wife Mrs Honoria Blackwood–a stout faced woman of middle age with blonde hair and a tendency to look down her nose at those who had the misfortune of crossing her path, their daughter Miss Cynthia Blackwood–a curly haired blonde beauty (particularly pointed out to him by his Aunt), and their second son Mr Fredrick Blackwood–a kind faced young man with hair just as blonde and curly as his sister’s. Their son and heir, Nathanial, was away in the continent for reasons, he could only assume, were less than savoury, judging by their vague explanation. <br/><br/>

					               	When Lord Blackwood had broached the subject of the school to his Aunt, she had subtly, but firmly, dismissed him. He should have known better! In his 30 years of life, he had never known her to be a humanitarian, but he knew full well the sort of matchmaking busybody she was. He had ceased coming to London four years ago, when he grew tired of the hordes of debutants and their matchmaking mamas chasing after him. He knew full well it was his title and money they were after.  <br/><br/>

					               	The only reason he’d bothered to journey back to London was because he had a fondness for his formidable Aunt, who was the elder sister of his late mother. While the Duchess’s 3 sons shrank away from her sharp tongue and stayed away for the majority of the year–only visiting for holidays and family functions–he took much pleasure in sparring with her. But he was beginning to think his spineless cousins had the right idea. To have been tricked by one of the few people he actually liked was intolerable. <br/><br/>

					               	The only thing that had kept him from making his excuses and leaving as soon as the opportunity presented itself, was the obvious discomfort of Miss Cynthia Blackwood, who was clearly just as shocked and dismayed as he was at this obvious attempt at matchmaking. After their conversation, he determined that she was a sensible young lady who had no designs on his title or fortune. Lord Blackwood thought himself a very good judge of character, and Miss Blackwood, who hadn’t batted her eyes at him or agreed with everything he said like all the other debutants, was most certainly not after his assets, he thought. Therefore, he offered to take her riding the following day, as a gesture of good will.  <br/><br/>

					               	Her brother, who had taken it upon himself to call him Blackwood–“we are cousins after all,” he insisted, “and you must call me Freddy”–caught a whiff of the scheme and invited himself along. He had failed to mention his intention to invite his Oxford chum, Mr Dingburry. Of course, he could not have predicted that Mr Dingburry would invite a party of his own friends. <br/><br/>

					               	So, that was how Lord Blackwood came to be in Hyde Park with a party of strangers, and for the second time in two days, he found himself in a situation he was not prepared for. <br/><br/>

					               	Miss Blackwood, being the perceptive young lady that she was, sensed his discomfiture and decided to rescue him. After all, she didn’t want to scare the wealthy Earl away, and this was the perfect opportunity to further her motives. “I’m afraid we’ll have to reschedule this outing for another day. We’ve quite forgotten we have a prior engagement in a quarter of an hour. My apologies,” she announced.  <br/><br/>

					               	Mr Dingburry, not wanting to miss his chance of being seen in the presence of the notorious Earl, argued, “But why should we all have to leave? Freddy, you and your sister can go. Blackwood and I will take charge of the outing, won’t we Blackwood?” <br/><br/>

					               	Shocked at the familiar manner he was being addressed in, Lord Blackwood opened his mouth to give the presumptuous young man a set down when Miss Blackwood intervened. “But when I said we, I did mean Lord Blackwood, Freddy and myself,” she said, with extra emphasis on ‘Lord’. “Mama is eager to thank the Duchess for reuniting us with our dear cousin, so we must make haste or we’ll be late. Again, I do apologies for the mix up.”<br/><br/>

					               	Confused, Freddy asked, “Late for what?” <br/><br/>

					               	“Nuncheon!” She exclaimed. “Lord Blackwood, you mustn’t forget to collect your dear Aunt. She’ll be wondering where you are,” she said with a secretive–but definitely not flirtatious–smile. Grateful for the chance to escape, Lord Blackwood smiled back and silently promised to repay her later. He said all that was polite to the rest and took his leave of them, hoping to never see them again. He raced his horse towards the entrance of the park, wanting to get as far away from the group as quickly as possible. <br/><br/>

					               	He had ridden but a few yards from the group when that chit had jumped out in front of his horse. Pegasus, his black gelding, was very temperamental and did not take kindly to being halted so abruptly. It had all happened so fast. The next thing he knew, he had been flung off of his horse. <br/><br/>

					               	As he laid tangled in the hedges, contemplating the last 24 hours, he heard a giggle, and his temper rose. He was at a loss to explain how in the past day, he–who was so in control of every aspect of his life–had first been bamboozled by his Aunt, then ambushed by that gudgeon Freddy and his friends, and now he sat in a bush, courtesy of an overeager debutant to get his attention. <br/><br/>

					               	With all of those thoughts whirling around his head, he swore under his breath and heard a shocked, “Sir!” in reply to his exclamations. So, the widgeon had decided to stick around had she. Of all the bacon-brained schemes to entrap him, jumping in front of his horse was by far the worst. The past attempts to win his favour had been tiresome and boring but apparently, his long absence from London had made the young ladies desperate and dangerous. They were, now, willing to risk it all for his suit. He couldn’t see the culprit, as he was currently face down in the hedges, but as soon as he untangled his person from the bush, he would give her a piece of his mind. <br/><br/>

					               	To make matters worse, that dolt Dingburry and the rest of the party he had hoped to never set eyes on again, were fast approaching. As he got back onto his feet, moments before Mr Dingbury arrived, he scanned his surroundings and scowled. The chit had fled. <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity handed the art supplies to the sales clerk and said, “I’ll take all of them.” After the catastrophe at the park two days ago and all the lecturing that had followed, she deserved a treat and painting was the one activity she enjoyed that her mother didn’t disapprove of. Her father’s only reaction to the whole incident was the sweeping of his hand through his greying red hair, then after a moments pondering, he declared, “Well, boys will be boys.” <br/><br/>

					               	Her mother, on the other hand, had lectured her for hours about the conduct of a young lady of her station. Mrs Billings, though past her first bloom of youth, still maintained her good looks, with dark brown hair and piercing hazel eyes. Eyes that were determine to see her children come up in the world. She, therefore, viewed the whole incident as a failing on her daughter’s part for not being prepared. As if Felicity should have known Charles would leave her unattended in the park, then crash the phaeton–injuring the horses in the process.  <br/><br/>

					               	“Well, why didn’t you take Clarisse with you?” Mrs Billings argued. <br/><br/>

					               	“Mama, you know perfectly well the phaeton only seats two,” she retorted. Even had it sat 12 people, she would not have asked Clarisse to accompany her. Clarisse, the beautiful French lady’s maid her mother insisted she have, spoke not one word of English; which would've been perfectly fine had Felicity spoken French, but she didn’t. Their communication consisted solely of smiling, nodding and awkward hand gestures. Felicity was not a fan of repeating herself, so elected to spend as little time with Clarisse as possible. <br/><br/>

					               	As much as she loved her mother, Felicity resented her constant admonitions. She knew her mother was displeased with her for having not been married yet, but, although she conceded to her rules about what she wore and where she went, she refused to be bullied into marriage.  <br/><br/>

					               	To spare herself any further sermons from her mother, she elected not to mention the incident with Nathaniel Blackwood, lest she develop a fit of the vapours, and with all the lecturing that had followed the incident two days ago, it had completely escaped her mind until Lady Grayson entered the shop. Lady Elizabeth Grayson, a tall blonde with laughing blue eyes and an aquiline nose, had been an heiress when she made her debut–one year before Felicity–and had married the Earl of Ryde the following year. It had been a marriage of convenience–she needed a title and he needed the funds–but the pair seemed to have built a strong connection in the years that followed. Theirs was a marriage that Felicity could only hope for if she was forced to marry a man solely to save him from financial ruin. <br/><br/>

					               	As she stood waiting for the clerk to wrap up her new supplies, Lady Grayson, with a warm smile, greeted her friend and introduced her to her cousin, Miss Rosaline Finchley, a red haired girl of about 19 with a splatter of freckles along her nose and cheeks. With all the usual niceties out of the way, Lady Grayson got straight to the point. <br/><br/>

					               	“I saw you from the shop window and had to fill you in on the latest on dit. I’m sure you already know about the Palmer’s Ball but you won’t believe who’s returned to London,” she said, looking stupefied. <br/><br/>

					               	“Nathaniel Blackwood,” Felicity blurted, excited at the opportunity to finally discuss her altercation at the park. She did not expect to see the laughter die from her friend’s eyes, or the red patches form on Miss Finchley’s face. <br/><br/>

					               	“Nathaniel Blackwood is in London?” This from Miss Finchley. <br/><br/>

					               	“Well, yes,” Felicity said, confusion marring her face. “Is that not what you were about to tell me?” She directed this at Lady Grayson, who seemed to be regaining her composure. <br/><br/>

					               	“Not quite, no.” Lady Grayson took a deep breath and after a moment of contemplation, she looked as if she had come to a decision. “I suppose I hadn’t told you about my relationship with Nathan.” She looked at Felicity to gage her reaction. <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity, always good at reading situations, had begun suspecting that her friend was the mysterious heiress who’d been abducted by Nathaniel Blackwood, the moment her expression transformed at the mention of his name. Her referring to him as ‘Nathan’ had only confirmed her suspicions. “You and Mr Blackwood were friends?” <br/><br/>

					               	Scanning the room to ensure no one was close enough to overhear her words, Lady Grayson lowered her voice and said, “We were more than friends, we were engaged at one point.” <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity gasped. “But, I thought-” <br/><br/>

					               	“I know the story of the abduction, and it’s true, for the most part. Nathan did lure me into his carriage and set off for Gretna Green when my parents rejected his offer. Luckily, we only made it as far as Enfield when my father caught up to us; but before that, before I realised the kind of man he truly was, I was very much in love with him,” she said, very matter-of-factly and without any sadness. “He was a very good actor. Indeed, I truly believed he loved me as I loved him.”<br/><br/>

					               	“Then why did your parents refuse him?” Felicity asked, eager to get the full story. <br/><br/>

					               	“Dear Fliss, I was fresh out of the schoolroom with a large fortune and ambitious parents. I would think you of all people would understand why my parents refused to consent to the marriage.” <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity did understand. No social climbing parent would sell their offspring for anything less than a Barony. Especially not on their first year out, and the bigger the fortune, the higher the title they could attain. Nathaniel Blackwood had no title or money, and the only pretentions he had to the peerage, was that of being the distant cousin of the Earl of De Montfort – a man famously known for disliking all but the few people he kept in his close circle. Nathaniel Blackwood was not one of those people. “What made you realise he didn’t truly care for you?” <br/><br/>

					               	“When I first realised we were eloping, I thought it rather romantic–the green girl that I was–but once my father caught up to us, and thank heavens he did, he informed Nathan that I’d be cut out of my inheritance if we insisted on going through with the marriage. He quickly dropped his act,” she said with a scowl. <br/><br/>

					               	“Oh Lizzy, I’m terribly sorry,” Felicity said, outraged at such blatant disregard for her friend’s feelings. <br/><br/>

					               	“You needn’t be sorry for me. My parents did a good job of hiding our involvement in the whole debacle, so the only people who really suffered any repercussions were <em>his</em> family.” <br/><br/>

					               	London was scandalised with the news of the attempted abduction of an ‘unnamed heiress’, in the papers the following day. Lady Grayson’s father had hired a Bow Street runner to help him track down the duo before they made it to the border, so news was bound to get out. Nathaniel had been overheard making arrangements for an elopement, prior to the incident, and society had put two and two together. With their daughter’s come out scheduled for the following year, the scandal was too great for the Blackwoods to ignore, so Nathaniel was banished to the continent, where–it was rumoured–he spent the next few years living at the mercy of his friend, Mr Felix Harding. <br/><br/>

					               	“Indeed, it was a good thing all around,” Lady Grayson continued. “Had it not happened to me, it would have happened to another unsuspecting heiress. It might have happened to you, Fliss. At least now he can’t get to anyone else in the country.”<br/><br/>

					               	“But that’s just it Lizzy, he can get to anyone in the country because he’s back in London,” Felicity argued. <br/><br/>

					               	This made Lady Grayson pause. “Where did you say you heard this information?” <br/><br/>

					               	“I didn’t hear it, I saw him with my own eyes. In Hyde Park. Not two days gone by. He almost ran me down with his horse,” Felicity exclaimed. <br/><br/>

					               	Miss Finchley, who had anxiously been listening to the exchange of the two women and close to bursting, finally spoke up, “If you had an encounter with Mr Blackwood at the park, believe me, it was no accident. He’s set his sights on you,” she said, franticly, “or more precisely, your money!” <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity’s eyes widened at this statement. <br/><br/>

					               	“Don’t be ridiculous Rosalind, you can’t know that,” Lady Grayson interjected. <br/><br/>

					               	“But I do know it. The man is dangerous and he’ll stop at nothing to gain his fortune. The things I’ve heard about what that scoundrels been up to in the continent. Things not fit for a lady’s ears.” Felicity wondered how Miss Finchley had come to hear of the blaggard’s escapades. <br/><br/>

					               	Miss Finchley continued “Not long ago, his friend Mr Harding–you know, the one they say he’s been scrounging off of, quite the scoundrel himself–anyway, this Mr Harding was spreading it around Paris that Mr Blackwood had left France to pursue what he referred to as, his ‘meal ticket’.” <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity was about to ask her where she had heard all of this when the shop assistant appeared with her package. She paid the clerk, then the ladies escorted her out of the shop. She knew her mother would be done at the milliners by now and would be making her way to the carriage, so they didn’t have long to talk. <br/><br/>

					               	“It makes no difference to me if Mr Blackwood has set his sights on my fortune or not. I’m no green girl, I won’t be falling for his tricks,” Felicity declared. <br/><br/>

					               	“If, indeed, what Rosaline says is true–and we can’t be certain it is–I wouldn’t underestimate Nathan’s powers of persuasion so easily, Fliss. You might not be straight out of the school room but you also don’t have experience with someone of his ilk,” Lady Grayson warned. Felicity supposed she was right, after all, none of the fortune hunters she’d dealt with had anything close to Nathaniel Blackwood’s reputation. <br/><br/>

					               	Miss Finchley, with a dreamy voice, said, “Plus, who could resist that handsome face, those broad shoulders…” <br/><br/>

					               	While Miss Finchley continued to list Mr Blackwood’s assets, Felicity came to the conclusion that the young lady had read too many romance novels. <br/><br/>

					               	“…those green eyes and silky golden tresses-” <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity fumbled, “Golden tresses? His hair is black.” <br/><br/>

					               	Lady Grayson looked confused, “Nathan doesn’t have black hair.” <br/><br/>

					               	Felicity thought back to their encounter. Sure, he had broad shoulders and somewhat of a handsome countenance. She could not be sure about the colour of his eyes but his hair was, most certainly, black. “Indeed, he does.” <br/><br/>

					               	It’s worse than I feared,” Miss Finchley interjected, horror evident in her tone, “he’s wearing a disguise.” <br/><br/>

					               	“Lady Grayson, how lovely to see you again.” With the arrival of Felicity’s mother, all talk of Mr Blackwood had come to an end. After a brief exchange, her mother was ushered into the carriage and Lady Grayson took the opportunity to readdress her friend. <br/><br/>

					               	“Darling, I wouldn’t worry too much about what Rosaline said, she has rather a flair for the dramatic, and I’m afraid she’s read one too many gothic novels.” With that, Felicity joined her mother in the carriage. <br/><br/>

					               	As a last minute thought, she poked her head out of the window and said, “Wait, who were <em>you</em> talking about? Who else has returned to London?” <br/><br/>

					               	Lady Grayson, on the verge of re-entering the shop, shouted after the moving carriage, “The Earl of De Montfort.” <br/><br/>

					               	“That Lady Grayson does like to give herself airs, doesn’t she? And that mother of hers is even worse. Turning her nose up at us. You’d think her daughter had married Prinny himself… But how unfortunate that she should’ve married that Earl. I don’t know why she didn’t hold out for another season, she might have bagged a Marquee…” <br/><br/>

					               	Mrs Billings’ senseless prattle and irrational dislike for Lady Grayson usually irritated Felicity–for, it wasn’t really Lady Grayson who she disliked but her mother, Mrs Louisa Finchley, who she was in constant competition with (a competition Mrs Billings was currently losing seeing as Mrs Finchley’s daughter had married an Earl)–but today, she was thankful for it. Mrs Billings could go on, uninterrupted, for hours. This gave Felicity the opportunity to think back on all that she had learned about Mr Blackwood. She wished she could agree with her friend, that she was in no danger of the scoundrel’s scheming; but the more she thought back on the incident at the park, the more she was convinced, it was no accident. <br/><br/>

					               	Jessamine counted to one hundred for the sixth time inside her head. The thrill of sneaking out of her bedroom at midnight to meet a gentleman was beginning to wear off as she waited for Mr William to arrive. Her James William. Butterflies returned in Jessamine’s stomach as she reminisced about her first dance with Mr William at the Grigori ball, and all the dances they had had since that night. Of course, they only danced once per night to keep up appearances.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine always blushed when she thought back to the first time Mr William had ever spoken to her in his low, husky voice. ‘May I have this dance, Miss Watson, if you are not engaged?’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She had replied that he may, all the while blushing, and in the moments that they danced, she had wished that she had not been wearing gloves so that their skin could make contact in those brief caresses.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine smiled now, as she stared out at the lake, and remembered the way Mr William’s hand had brushed her shoulder the night before when nobody was watching. What a fine man! The most charming and handsome she had laid her eyes upon. Most ladies to come across him were instantly smitten, including Jessamine, and she prided the fact that he clearly had an interest in her.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	The attention Mr William paid to Jessamine had not been lost on Emily Beaton, the younger of the two sisters who happened to be Jessamine’s cousins, although they had never got along. She definitely had not missed when Mr William quickly slipped his hand into Jessamine’s for a brief second in passing, while they thought nobody was watching. Emily certainly would not have noticed if she had not been watching Mr William so intensely all night.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	What Emily did not know was that Mr William was passing a note to Jessamine, telling her to meet him at the lake at a quarter past midnight the very next night. Jessamine hid the note and it had felt as if it was burning a hole into her glove the whole rest of the night, but she knew she couldn’t open it at the ball in front of everyone. As she slipped the note into her glove, she caught a glimpse of Emily Beaton, eyes fixed on her, but Emily quickly averted her gaze when she noticed Jessamine looking back at her.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	What a curious exchange it was! Emily felt tempted to ask about the brief encounter but did not want Jessamine to be aware that she had caught on to something between the two.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Have you been enjoying yourself, Jessamine?’ Emily Beaton asked.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine was far too excited about the events of the night to entertain Beaton and so replied, ‘Yes, thank you very much, Emily’ and she bowed her head and walked away, without so much as asking how Miss Beaton was enjoying her night, much to her displeasure.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine sighed as she waited by the tree, looking out towards the lake. She was sure that it was far past a quarter past midnight and she was beginning to grow cold. She wished that she had been able to tell her maid, Lucy, about this secret meeting, as her stays were coming loose, seeing as she had to dress herself, but she could not risk being caught leaving her bedroom at this hour of the night. The servants might talk and it was not proper for a young lady to be out alone with a man her father had not given his approval of, especially at this time of the night.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine wondered if she’d somehow read Mr William’s letter wrong. Did she have the wrong night, possibly the wrong time? Or perhaps, Jessamine thought, Mr William had come to his senses and realised that he had no business in pursuing her. Their situation was rather unique.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine turned to leave. It was getting far too cold and it wasn’t safe for her to be outside all alone. However, when she turned, she saw a dark figure walking towards her. A sudden panic came over her. What if it wasn’t Mr William? What if the whole thing was a set-up? But she needn’t worry.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Miss Watson?’ Oh how she’d never tire of hearing his voice utter her name.<br>
					               	‘James.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Mr William placed his hand on Jessamine’s cheek, much to her surprise. He had never been so forward with her, although they had also never been alone together.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘You’re cold. I’m sorry I have kept you waiting, Miss Watson.’<br>
					               	‘Never mind about that. You’re here now.’ She placed her hand on top of his but he quickly slipped his away and turned to face the lake.<br>
					               	‘Yes.’<br>
					               	‘Is something the matter, Mr William?’<br>
					               	‘I just cannot seem to shake the feeling that this is very wrong, Miss Watson. I’m sorry for wasting your time but I must take you home now.’<br>
					               	Jessamine shook her head. ‘No, you haven’t. I didn’t manage to pack any of my things but if we leave now we can make it to Gretna Green by-’<br>
					               	‘Gretna Green?’ Mr William turned back to face Jessamine, eyes wide. ‘I’m sorry to have misled you, Miss Watson, but we cannot elope to Gretna Green.’<br>
					               	Jessamine placed her hand on Mr William’s arm. ‘But why not?’<br>
					               	‘You know very well why not, Miss Watson.’<br>
					               	‘Very well then.’ Jessamine bowed her head, lifted her skirts and turned to run back home.
					               </p>

					               <p class="text-center">***</p>

					               <p>
					               	‘Jessie.’ her younger sister, Rosanna, whispered as they lay in bed the very same night. It was not an uncommon practice for Rosanna to sneak into her bedroom and join her whenever she was having a bad dream. Jessamine had returned to find her asleep in her bed and had tried her best to undress quietly.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Hmm?’ Jessamine stroked her sister’s hair as they lay beside each other.<br>
					               	‘Did you go to see the man you danced with at the ball?’<br>
					               	Jessamine’s eyes, which were drooping a moment before, shot wide open. ‘You read too many fairy tales, Rose.’<br>
					               	‘I won’t tell. I just saw him passing you something at the ball.’<br>
					               	‘It was nothing. Forget it.’<br>
					               	‘Do you think he’ll ask for your hand, Jessie?’<br>
					               	‘I doubt that very much, Rose. Now go to sleep.’
					               </p>

					               <p class="text-center">***</p>

					               <p>
					               	It was 10am. Jessamine stood at the back of the church as she watched the guests of the wedding arrive. It was a rather large sum of people but she wasn’t surprised. It was typical of the Beaton’s to make such a show of things and inviting as many guests as possible was the best way for the family to do that. Jessamine was certain that she would not invite the Beaton’s to her eventual wedding. She did not need their beady eyes watching her every move and ruining her special day. Her wedding would be small, only immediate family and close friends.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Mrs Watson appeared at Jessamine’s side. ‘It’s time to take a seat, dear.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	As they walked arm in arm to their pew, where they were to be seated beside her two sisters, Jessamine couldn’t help but imagine for a second that it was her own wedding that she was walking down the aisle to. Jessamine watched the groom fidget with his clothing, first his collar, then his coat and his collar again. She was sure that if his tailcoat was taken off, damp marks would stain his shirt at the underarms. His nerves were understandable, marrying one of the Beaton ladies. Finally, a hush fell over the church. Isabella Beaton, the elder of the two sisters, walked with her father down the aisle in a light blue dress.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	This was Jessamine’s least favourite part of the wedding. She grew restless as she listened to the priest. Mrs Watson placed her hand on Jessamine’s knee. She had been shaking her leg, a habit that she didn’t notice she was doing most of the time. Her mother was constantly reminding her to break it as it was unladylike, not to mention irritating.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Therefore, if any man can show any just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She could not help herself. Jessamine shot up from her seat before she even had the chance to think about what she was doing.<br>
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘Jessamine!’ Her mother tugged at her dress. ‘Sit down.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	All eyes were on her, and she could almost feel Emily Beaton’s glare, but Jessamine took no notice. All she could see was the love of her life standing at the alter with another woman; an undeserving woman.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘They cannot be wed.’ Jessamine moved out of her pew, much to her mother’s protest, and stood in the aisle of the church. ‘They cannot be wed because I am in love with James, and he with me.’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	She could hear the mutterings of the people in the church but chose to ignore it, instead walking towards the back of the building.<br>
					               	‘Is this true?’ Isabella asked her husband to be.<br>
					               	Mr William looked from Isabella to Jessamine and back again. He took a step away from his bride. ‘I’m terribly sorry, but…’
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine willed for the groom to look at her. All she needed was a second of eye contact. He turned his head towards her and she nodded at him. Mr William hesitated for a second and then made a break for it towards Jessamine. She placed her hand in his, much to everyone’s shock, and they ran out of the church towards the carriage.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	‘To Gretna Green?’ Mr William asked.<br>
					               	She nodded. ‘To Gretna Green.’<br>
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Jessamine blinked. She was back in the church again, sitting beside her mother and sister, Elizabeth.<br>
					               	‘I, James William, take thee, Isabella Beaton, to be my wedded wife.’<br>
					               	Jessamine sighed. She never was a big fan of weddings anyway.

I wish people still sent letters but the fact that they don’t just makes them that much more special. I’d like to think that one day someone will think of me and decide to put pen to paper and write to me. Their thoughts, their feelings, anything. I’d keep that piece of paper forever, put it in my special box of memories and smile every time I looked at it. Maybe they’d even spray it with a scent so that I’d think of them and their words every time I smelt it.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I do things that I wish people would do for me. I write letters in the hopes that someday someone will write one to me. Maybe I watch too many movies and have this romantic idea of life that just isn’t a reality, but if I can’t experience that little bit of magic in the world then why not make it happen for someone else?
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	Do you ever remember someone from your childhood and wonder if they think of you? Like someone who you were friends with for a short while but for some reason that friendship didn’t last? There was no official breaking of the friendship, it just kind of faded away, but for that short time you really valued that person’s company? Do you ever wonder if that person thinks of that short time too? Do you ever wonder if they even remember it happened? Do you wonder if they valued it as much as you did?
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I want you to know that I’m thinking of you. Before I started writing this letter, I was thinking of you. As I sit here expressing my thoughts, I am thinking of you. When I seal the envelope and place the stamp on its corner, I will think of you.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	I hope you will value this letter as much as I would. I hope you get excited when you receive your mail and realise that you’ve been sent a letter which isn’t a bill or an expected delivery or a subscription. I hope you will get a giddy feeling inside and wonder what it could possibly say inside. I hope you won’t be disappointed at the words you read or the fact that it was sent from me. I hope you feel special and loved, and I hope you know that your friendship meant everything to me.
					               </p>
					               <p>
					               	It breaks my heart to know that things between us will never be the same again, that at one point you were my everything and now I’m beginning to fear that I’ll forget someday. I’ll forget the sound of your voice or the smell of your cologne. One thing I know for certain is that I’ll never forget the memories that we shared. They’re forever ingrained in my memory. They always will be.
